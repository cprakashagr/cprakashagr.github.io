              I have worked with snapwiz and worked on end to end product development which included android application, image processing and backend APIs development. It has been a great experience for me. I learnt many things right after graduating from college. Soon after joining snapwiz as an initial "Android Focused Developer" (which I learnt as an hobby in my college days), I jumped into many more roles and started taking responsibilities across computer vision (also learnt in college), backend development etc. The research wing has given me a good exposure to modern practices across various domains.<br><br>

              Across multiple domains, below are few of my key contributions to snapwiz:<br><br>

              ** AI, Data Science, Crawls:
              <ul>
                <li>Built a recommendation algorithm based on location filter<br>
                The app, "glider.ai" has a recommendation engine which recommends candidates to jobs and vice versa based on many factors. One of the key factors was location. The design of this recommendation algorithm was to filter intersections based on location and recommend candidates and jobs to each other.</li><br>
                <li>Generic crawler to aggregate candidates' public profile information<br>
                While working for the recommendation algorithms, we had to test our engine with many jobs and candidates. Genereting synthetic data was a solution but we wanted to test with the real data. So, we created a generic crawler that can extract jobs and candidates information from multiple platforms.</li><br>
                <li>Image Processing using OpenCV<br>
                One of the interesting tasks, we were caught up was about finding open and closed patches from certain types of images. So, working back on C++ after about 4+ years was a fun and refreshing. Apart from this, I also created a native application for android.</li><br>
              </ul>
              ** Architect Design:
              <ul>
                <li>Solution for dynamic UI rendering which is solely controlled by web service call<br>
                    While I was working for an android application, there was an idea that the android application home activity will have dynamic UIs which can be changed on the fly as well. So, architecting this design where tthis can be controlled from the server was relatively a small design but I enjoyed it.
                </li><br>
                <li>Solution for Graph Data Structure and Finite Automata based pagination design<br>
                    That's a fancy name. I know. But, the usual pagination based on comparing the inputs from the users and navigating was actually very costly. I was able to decreas the conditional load time for upcoming screens by over 41%. And it worked like a charm.</li>
              </ul>
              ** Docker & Bash:<br>
              When we learnt about Docker and it power, we became excited. So, the research wing wanted me to explore that and migrate the existing projects to it. More than that, there were many small modules that were made in the main app, where some sort of virtualisation was needed while assessing the candidates in the glider platform. Few pointers from Docker:<br>
              <ul>
                <li>Docker image management simplification with proper hierarchy levels</li>
                <li>Docker migration for multiple project modules along with their performance profiling and performance testing</li>
                <li>Multiple shell scripting to automate several repetitive tasks in cloud servers and docker containers</li>
              </ul>
              ** Brain Storming:
              <ul>
                <li>Authored many brain storming and complex puzzles & projects in Python and Java8<br>
                    Not only that, writing unit tests for these puzzles for the first time was fun. This exercise brought out the old memories from my college.
                </li>
              </ul>
              ** Applications Development:
              <ul>
                <li>Holistic android project development<br>
                    I worked on several android applications namely: Glider Jobs (Currently De-Published), <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ai.glider.assessments" target="_blank">Glider Assessment Screen</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.snapwiz.eduscanner&hl=en" target="_blank">Edulastic SnapScore.</li></a><br>
                <li>We Service APIs for devices<br>
                    The interaction of android application and server was done through socket connections using DDP protocol. I created many server side functions for this.
                </li>
              </ul>
              ** Video Processing:
              <ul>
                <li>Very basic video processing to decrease video file size<br>
                    Using multiple compression techniques, changing codecs and frame properties, I was able to decrease certain video sizes so that smaller video can be uploaded from the android / iOS devices in slower 2G / 3G connections.</li>
              </ul>
              ** Open Source Contributions<br>
              <ul>
                <li>Worked with an IntelliJ plugin which runs android application in a very light environment<br>
                  Emulator roughly takes 3-4 minutes to load and run and android application. The plugin could launch the application within 3 seconds. The downside was that it cannot be used for debugging purpose and native C++ codes cannot be run.</li><br>
                <li>Contributed to Meteor <a href="https://github.com/delight-im/Android-DDP/blob/master/Extensions.md" target="_blank">DDP Library</a><br>
                    This contribution made social accounts login possible in the Meteor DDP android and iOS library.</li>
